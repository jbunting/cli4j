cli4j
-----

A CLI command framework for Java. Heavily inspired by [Click](click) and [JAX-RS](jaxrs). Based on parsing from 
[JCommander](jcommander) and console interaction from [JLine](jline).

 [click]: http://click.pocoo.org/4/
 [jaxrs]: https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/
 [jcommander]: http://jcommander.org/
 [jline]: http://jline.github.io/jline2/
                             
The goal is to make it simple and easy for Java developers to write multi-command style shell tools.
